# Netlify Issues

## 1. After generate site by Hugo, Netlify cannot deploy all the time.

Ok, this issue really sucks!!!!!

But I still find a solution: add a netlify.toml file at your root directory, check my file under the this repo.

More details check [here](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/).

## 2. Build failed with error code: 255

Delete and adjust wrong files then rebuild site again.
